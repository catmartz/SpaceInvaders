# Space Invaders
Cat Martins and Jake Murakami

## Project description:
This project is based on the game Space Invaders, a 1978 “shoot 'em up” arcade game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado. To play, run the main class in SpaceInvaders.java. The objective of Space Invaders is to move your space ship horizontally across a screen using the left/right arrow keys and shoot the descending swarms of aliens with the space bar, thus preventing them from reaching the bottom of the screen. When an alien reaches the player, the game ends and a score screen displays the player’s score. To win, destroy all the aliens! You have 3 lives to try to get them all! Click the "play again" button to play as many times as you want.

## Acknowledgments:
Huge shout out to Preceptor Tim and Professor Jackson for helping us will all our bugs!

## Known Choices (issues):
Make sure you hit the aliens towards the middle of their ships! That's where the engine is! We chose to do this to make the game more difficult. 

## Future of this Project:
Stay tuned for the aliens fighting back!
